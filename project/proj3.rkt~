;; a board is a (listof (listof piece)) representing a rectangular

;; by a list of pieces, where the pieces are ordered from outermost
;; (i.e., biggest) to innermost (smallest).  An square with no pieces
;; is represented by the empty list.  The order of the squares in
;; this list is row-major order; for example, the playing board
;; squares are ordered as follows:

;;    0 1 2
;;    3 4 5
;;    6 7 8

;; - next is a player,

;;   - binv ("blue inventory") is an inventory, and
