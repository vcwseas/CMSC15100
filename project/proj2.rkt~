;; an inventory is a (listof piece) ordered by increasing size

;; a board is a (listof (listof piece)) representing a rectangular
;; grid of squares.  The playing board is a 3x3 grid, while the
;; inventory boards are 3x2 grids. Each square is represented
;; by a list of pieces, where the pieces are ordered from outermost
;; (i.e., biggest) to innermost (smallest).  An square with no pieces
;; is represented by the empty list.  The order of the squares in
;; this list is row-major order; for example, the playing board
;; squares are ordered as follows:
;;
;;    0 1 2
;;    3 4 5
;;    6 7 8

;; a game is a (make-game next inv board) where
;; - next is a player, 
;; - inv is a pair (make-pair oinv binv), where
;;   - oinv ("orange inventory") is an inventory,
;;   - binv ("blue inventory") is an inventory, and
;; - board is a board (per definition above)
;; NOTE: the inventories are stored in a pair structure now;
;;       this differs from the project 1 design
